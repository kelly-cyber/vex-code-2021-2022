This version has working odometry code, worked with SPACEBAR on discord to get odom working

Problems:
1. If the robot is turned a lot, the values aren't correct. I think it's bc the encoders are turning but the robot's global position isn't actually changing
2. Values of encoders don't start at zero even though the global variables are set to 0.
